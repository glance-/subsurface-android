Tool repo to crosscompile subsurface to android-arm
---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:

1. android_sdk, android_ndk and Qt5.3.0. See step 0.
2. cmake
3. ant
4. Java JDK
5. working adb is recommended
6. dependencies of libdivecomputer and subsurface -
   visit http://subsurface.hohndel.org/documentation/building/

Steps to install:

Step 0.
Grab..
Android ndk from: http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
Android sdk from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download
And QT for android from: http://qt-project.org/downloads

Step 1.
Extract and install these into known directories.
Have a look in the top of build.sh for where the cross build tool expects
them. By default thats is: ../android-ndk-r9d ../android-sdk-linux and
../Qt5.3.0/5.3

Step 2.
Run bash build.sh in the terminal. By default it builds for arm but you
can pass x86 as first arg to build.sh to have it build for x86. Nice when
debugging in a fast emulator.
The script will download and build the whole dependency chain.

After this, subsurface will be built for android.

The output folder is subsurface-build-arm/android_build and your newly
created apk shows up as:
subsurface-build-arm/android_build/bin/QtApp-debug.apk

Where the x86 apk shows up when built for x86 is left as a exercise for the
reader.
