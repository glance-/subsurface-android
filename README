Tool repo to crosscompile subsurface to android-arm
---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:

1. android_sdk, android_ndk and Qt5.2.1. See step 0.
2. cmake
3. ant
4. Java
5. working adb is recommended
6. dependencies of libdivecomputer and subsurface -
   visit http://subsurface.hohndel.org/documentation/building/

Steps to install:

Step 0.
Grab..
Android ndk from: http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
Android sdk from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download
And QT for android from: http://qt-project.org/downloads

Extract and install these into known directories.
Let these directories be android_ndk, android_sdk and Qt5.2.1

Step 1.
Edit build.sh script present in this repository to set proper path to
android_sdk, android_ndk and Qt5.2.1 as per your system. (lines 2-4)
Also decide the android version you are building for (line 6)

Step 2.
Run bash build.sh in the terminal.
The script will download and build the following libraries for android
1. libsqlite3
2. libxml2
3. libxslt
4. libgit2
5. libusb1
6. libdivecomputer

After this, subsurface will be built for android.

The output folder is subsurface-build/android_build
You can import this folder in eclipse and run in your android devices.
